    // pseudonymity is a property of the Blind-Date group: inside it the two write as
    // „Blind-Date-Partner 1" and „2" and there is no private chat between those two labels.
    // Outside it they are ordinary members who may write to each other like anybody else —
    // asking somebody for a role-play by message is the platform working, and two accounts
    // happening to share a Blind-Date is no reason to prevent it.
    //
    // The cost was weighed and accepted: a member who suspects who their partner is could write
    // to that person and compare. Neither of them knows the other is the same person, so neither
    // notices the comparison being made — and the guard against a real name reaching the group
    // is the masking, not this refusal.
